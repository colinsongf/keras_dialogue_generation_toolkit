## Data format
In this folder level, it contains each of the data set. You can put whatever data sets you want to put here, such as MSDialogue, Twitter or Ubuntu Dialogue data set. In the example\_data folder, there are three folders: train, valid and test data folder. You can config the folder's name (Just ignore the example's folder name).

For the data format, taking the symblic\_single\_turn\_train\_path as an example. The pro\_qa.txt is the question and answer (ground truth). The format is like:

* line\_id\tquestion\tanswer.

The line\_id doesn't mean anything, just a unique id for each line. When you use the knowledge-injecting models, this id will be checked with the knowledge data set on line-wise.

The sent\_fact.txt is for the knowledge-injecting models. Each line stands for a set of background knowledge corresponding to the question (with the same line\_id). The knowledge is saperated by '\t'.

global.src.token.dic is the vocabulary file, which is generated by the pro\_qa.txt. Here, I just give an example, readers can produce their own vocabulary file. Please just follow its format.


Note: All of the folder names and file names can be configed in the configure/config.ini.
