19	forgetting or disremembering is the apparent loss or modification of information already encoded and stored in an individual 's long term memory	many different factors influence the actual process of forgetting	forgetting also helps to reconcile the storage of new information with old knowledge	age related memory loss , sometimes described as " normal aging " , is qualitatively different from memory loss associated with dementias such as alzheimer 's disease , and is believed to have a different brain mechanism	symptoms often include misplacing items , forgetting events or appointments , and having trouble finding words	memory gaps and errors refer to the incorrect recall , or complete loss , of information in the memory system for a specific detail and or event	often memory is understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor , short term ( or working ) memory , and long term memory ( baddely , 2007 )	the hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short term memory to long term memory , and in spatial memory that enables navigation	autobiographical memory is a memory system consisting of episodes recollected from an individual 's life , based on a combination of episodic ( personal experiences and specific objects , people and events experienced at particular time and place ) and semantic ( general knowledge and facts about the world ) memory	motivated forgetting is a theorized psychological behavior in which people may forget unwanted memories , either consciously or unconsciously	retrograde amnesia ( ra ) is a loss of memory access to events that occurred , or information that was learned , before an injury or the onset of a disease	the de novo protein synthesis theory of memory formation is a hypothesis about the formation of the physical correlates of memory in the brain	as the retention interval between encoding and retrieval of the memory lengthens , there is an increase in both the amount that is forgotten , and the likelihood of a memory error occurring	memory performance is usually related to the active functioning of three stages	it tends to negatively affect episodic , autobiographical , and declarative memory while usually keeping procedural memory intact with no difficulty for learning new knowledge	conway and pleydell pearce ( 2000 ) proposed that autobiographical memory is constructed within a self memory system ( sms ) , a conceptual model composed of an autobiographical knowledge base and the working self	while pta lasts , new events cannot be stored in the memory	when continuous memory returns , pta is considered to have resolved	memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded , stored , and retrieved	mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) is a condition in which people face memory problems more often than that of the average person their age	it is a spontaneous or gradual process in which old memories are unable to be recalled from memory storage	about a third of patients with mild head injury are reported to have " islands of memory " , in which the patient can recall only some events	memory is vital to experiences and related to limbic systems , it is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action	yea ( ) is a town in victoria , australia north east of melbourne at the junction of the goulburn valley highway and the melba highway , in the shire of murrindindi local government area	memory errors may include remembering events that never occurred , or remembering them differently from the way they actually happened	the relative strength of various synapses in a network of neurons form the memory trace , or engram , though the processes that support this finding are less thoroughly understood	though descriptions of the condition are based on fewer than 100 cases published in the medical literature , and the largest single study to date included 50 people with tea , tea offers considerable theoretical significance as competing theories of human memory attempt to reconcile its implications	a person experiencing a tea episode has very little short term memory , so that there is profound difficulty remembering events in the past few minutes ( anterograde amnesia ) , or of events in the hours prior to the onset of the attack , and even memories of important events in recent years may not be accessible during the amnestic event ( retrograde amnesia )	humans and other mammals have two hippocampi , one in each side of the brain	problems with remembering , learning and retaining new information are a few of the most common complaints of older adults	in an area originally inhabited by the taungurong people , it was first visited by europeans of the hume and hovell expedition in 1824 , and within 15 years most of the land in the area

confusion that occurs immediately following a traumatic brain injury in which the injured person is disoriented and unable to remember events that occur after the injury	during pta , the patient 's consciousness is " clouded "	the type of information that is forgotten can be very specific , like a single event , or more general , resembling generic amnesia	it is widely accepted that the physiological correlates for memories are stored at the synapse between various neurons	thought suppression is a method in which people protect themselves by blocking the recall of these anxiety arousing memories	the hippocampus ( named after its resemblance to the seahorse , from the greek , " seahorse " from " hippos " , " horse " and " kampos " , " sea monster " ) is a major component of the brains of humans and other vertebrates	the management of traumatic memories is important when treating mental health disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder	the de novo protein synthesis theory states that the production of proteins is required to initiate and potentially maintain these plastic changes within the brain	the hippocampus is located under the cerebral cortex ( allocortical ) and in primates in the medial temporal lobe	it states that there is a time gradient in retrograde amnesia , so that recent memories are more likely to be lost than the more remote memories	the autobiographical knowledge base contains knowledge of the self , used to provide information on what the self is , what the self was , and what the self can be	ra can be temporally graded or more permanent based on the severity of its cause and is usually consistent with ribot 's law : where subjects are more likely to lose memories closer to the traumatic incident than more remote memories	it is an example of defence mechanism , since these are unconscious or conscious coping techniques used to reduce anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful impulses thus it can be defence mechanism in some ways	transient epileptic amnesia ( tea ) is a rare but probably underdiagnosed neurological condition which manifests as relatively brief and generally recurring episodes of amnesia caused by underlying temporal lobe epilepsy	the sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to with various levels of focus and intent	ribot 's split from the mainstream " eclectic " psychology of the era was associated with a transition from philosophical to evolutionary explanations of human psychology and behavior	these errors or gaps can occur due to a number of different reasons , including the emotional involvement in the situation , expectations and environmental changes	not all patients suffering from retrograde amnesia report the symptoms of ribot 's law	ribot 's law of retrograde amnesia was hypothesized in 1881 by th odule ribot	for example , if something reminds a person of an unpleasant event , his or her mind may steer towards unrelated topics	when simple objects such as a photograph , or events such as a birthday party , bring traumatic memories to mind people often try to bar the unwanted experience from their minds so as to proceed with life , with varying degrees of success	they result from traumatic experiences , including natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis violent events such as kidnapping , terrorist attacks , war , domestic abuse and rape	these three stages are encoding , storage and retrieval	surveyed in 1855 , the township grew as a service centre for grazing , gold mining and timber getting in the area	traumatic memories are naturally stressful in nature and emotionally overwhelm people 's existing coping
